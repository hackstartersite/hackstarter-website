    <h1>4. Deep Dive: What is Hacking?</h1>

    <p>This section is for the curious. Explore as many (or as few) of the topics below as you want. Only the real ones will actually explore everything — but there’s no pressure. Only the “Done exploring?” checkbox at the bottom counts toward lesson completion.</p>
    <p>Hackstarter doesn't provide all the info about a topic, but it is a good <strong>starting point</strong>. If you are interested in any topic below, you can use the internet to find out more about it.</p>

      <p>CTFs (Capture The Flag competitions) train hackers through puzzles that simulate real-world attacks. Think of it as the gym for ethical hacking skills — timed, fun, and competitive.</p>

      <p>Suppose you find a flaw in a system without permission — do you report it? Ethics in hacking isn’t always black and white. This is where white hats and gray hats start to blur.</p>
