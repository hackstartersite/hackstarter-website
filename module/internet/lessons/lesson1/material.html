    <h1>1. Material: What is Hacking?</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your first lesson on Hackstarter. You're standing at the edge of a vast digital world — the real world — one hidden beneath apps, browsers, and shiny buttons. The internet is not what it seems. It's more than just websites. It's a living, breathing system of endless connections — and you're about to learn how to control it.</p>
    <h2>Hacking</h2>
    <p><strong>Hacking</strong> is gaining unathorized access to a device.</p>
    <p>But <strong>Hacking</strong> is not just breaking into systems — it's breaking <i>free</i> of them</p>
    <p>It's the art of understanding something so deeply that you can bend it to your will. It's curiosity turned into power. And it's everywhere: from jailbreaking a phone to finding a flaw in a billion-dollar corporation's code.</p>

    <h2>Types of Hackers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>White Hat:</strong> Ethical hackers who help defend systems and find bugs before the bad guys do.</li>
      <li><strong>Black Hat:</strong> Hackers who attack systems illegally for money, data, or chaos.</li>
      <li><strong>Gray Hat:</strong> Hackers who operate in the gray zone — not always legal, but not always malicious either.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Analogy</h2>
    <p>Imagine a building with a locked door:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>white hat</strong> tests the door, reports any weakness, and helps the owner install a better lock.</li>
      <li>The <strong>black hat</strong> tries to pick the lock and steal what’s inside.</li>
      <li>The <strong>gray hat</strong> sneaks in, finds the weak lock, and tells the owner... but didn’t have permission to do it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Hackstarter Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
    <p>This platform is a safe and ethical space to learn how systems work, how they’re attacked, and how to defend them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ No illegal activities</li>
      <li>✔️ All learning is simulated</li>
      <li>✔️ You’ll grow powerful — and responsible</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The First Hacker Truth</h2>
    <i>"If you can understand it, you can control it."</i>
    <p>This is your first step. Understanding how machines speak. Next, you'll learn how to speak back — and eventually, how to speak louder than them.</p>
